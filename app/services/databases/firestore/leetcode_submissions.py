        1. Get the user's submission document by uuid
        2. If user's submission document doesn't exist, create it with the initial submission
        3. Else, update the submission with the new submission data

        Note: Submission could be an attempt or solving the problem. We always assume
        at least one is not None, so we can update the submission

        This means that one timestamp will remain the same, while the other will be updated
