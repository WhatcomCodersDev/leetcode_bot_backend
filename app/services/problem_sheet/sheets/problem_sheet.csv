Less Common
Union Find - find/count disjoint sets, adding path compression is one line but improves runtime massively
Dijkstra - shortest path, works for weighted, no negative weights allowed (E log V)
Longest Path - brute force exhaustive DFS will work everytime; but if acyclic, there is also a solution involving topo sort/DP
Cycle Detection - for directed graph, use topo sort; for undirected, can use DFS or union find
Rare
Bellman Ford - shortest path, weighted and negative weights allowed (E * V)

371,Task Scheduler,https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/,Medium,Math,,,X,X,X,X,"do the greedy approach where you use both a maxHeap and a queue.

basically in maxHeap keep track of all negative count values, in queue append both the updated count AND the time it can get processed
while maxHeap or q:
increment time by 1
if maxHeap, then pop from maxHeap, add 1 to the count popped, check if it's not 0, then push to queue with time it takes to get processed
if q and q[0][1] == current time, push the count value from the popped queue value back to the heap

after while loop, just return time"
